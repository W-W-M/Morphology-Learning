# Cell-growth-on-scaffold-by-morphology-learning 
#### Our project is composed of two parts: morphology learning and structural optimization.
Abstract
`rgb(100, 2, 399)`We introduce a novel neural network-based computational pipeline as a representation-agnostic slicer for multi-axis 3D printing. 
The background color [is]`green` for light [mode and]`#000000` for dark mode.
